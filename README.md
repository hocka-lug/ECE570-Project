# ECE570-Project Neural Network on Contextual Bandits using Upper Confidence Bound

This code re-implements previous work on contextual bandits which are a variation of the multi-armed bandit problem. They differ the multi-armed bandits due to the context which is obtained by associating side information per each step.
