# ECE570-Project Neural Network on Contextual Bandits using Upper Confidence Bound

Project is based on previous work on contextual bandits which are a variation of the multi-armed bandit problem. They differ from multi-armed bandits due to the context which is obtained by associating side information on each step.
This code is the reimplementation of the one included with the paper Neural Contextual Bandits with UCB-based Exploration by Zhou et al.
